# KDE Plasma Breeze for Visual Studio Code Changelog

✨ Catch the Breeze ✨
-------------------------

Introducing the most precise theme matching for KDE Plasma Desktop: Breeze (Dark &amp; Light). It is perfect for coding, in all environments, with a balanced palette of colors.

Carefully calibrated for KDE Plasma Desktops
--------------------------------------------

KDE Plasma Breeze is deliberately designed to harmonize the theme and ensure visual consistency within KDE Plasma. The initial release includes two themes (Breeze Light &amp; Breeze Dark), enabling VS Code to integrate seamlessly with the KDE Plasma desktop environment, thus providing a more aesthetically pleasing experience.

Future Plans/Projects
---------------------

Developing additional themes to align with KDE Plasma themes, such as Breeze Twilight, Fedora, Sweet KDE, macOS clone, and other applications.
