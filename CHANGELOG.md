# KDE Plasma Breeze for Visual Studio Code Changelog

✨ Catch the Breeze ✨
-------------------------

Say hello to the most accurate themes matching Breeze (Dark & Light) for the KDE Plasma Desktop. Ideal for coding in any environment with a balanced color pallete.

Carefully calibrated for KDE Plasma Desktops
--------------------------------------------

KDE Plasma Breeze is thoughtfully designed to coordinate the theme providing visual consistency with KDE Plasma. The initial release includes two themes (Breeze Light & Breeze Dark) allowing VS Code to seemlessly blend within the KDE Plasma desktop environment, this theme ensures a more aesthetically pleasing experience.

Future Plans/Projects
---------------------

Working on additional themes to match KDE Plasma themes (i.e. Breeze Twilight, Feddora, Sweet KDE, macOS clone) as well as other apps.
